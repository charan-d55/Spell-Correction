# Spell-Correction

For Assignment I have used the Levenshtein distance of all the words in the Brikbeck corpus with every word in WordNet corpus. The task aims to find correct spelling of mis-spelled words in the Brikbeck corpus.

Also i have created the corpus by myself using the birkbeck.dat file from https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ROGER/corpora.html
used this file and tried to make pairs for correct and incorrect word.
